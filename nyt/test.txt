Berlin Explains Views on Eastern Pact;
" Calls Military Clause Peace Menace

 

By The Associated Press.

BERLIN, April 13.—The text of a communique? issued today by
the German Government, giving its attitude on the proposed Eastern

pact, follow:

Misleading statements in' the
press have induced thé govern-
ment to clarify its standpoint in
the matter of an Eastern‘pact as
follows:

First, the Fuehrer informed the
British delegation that the Ger-
man Government, to its regret, is
unable to declare adhesion to an
Eastern pact in its proposed form.

It is, however, ready to consent
to such a collective security pact
if it is based upon mutual and
general non-aggression obligations
and arbitration; if it provides for
consultative procedure in case of
disturbance of the peace; and,
finally, the German Government
is willing—while emphasizing the
difficulties indisputably determin-
ing the aggressorﬂto join in gen-
eral measures for non—support of
such an aggressor. By this offer
the government stands today.

Second, the Fuehrer Intimated
during this discussion that Ger-
many is not able to consent to a
pact proposal which for all or for
individual States contains more or
less automatic obligations for mili-

tary assistance, on the grounds
that this would carry elements
menacing peace rather than for
maintaining peace. The German
Government is still of this epin-
ion.

Third, the government immedi-
ately, upon assuming power, ex—
pressed the wish to- conclude non-
aggression pacts with adjacent
countries. It has made this pro-
posal without the knowledge of
and without reference to bilateral
or multilateral pacts existing be-
tween single States. Since the
German Government has no ag-
gressive intentions it does not feel
affected by defensive agreements.
This standpoint the German Gov-
ernment still maintains.

Just as little as it is able to join
a pact that contains such mili-
tary obligations as essential ele-
ments, just so little can such
agreements outside of this pact
prevent Germany from concluding
non-aggression pacts on the basis

indicated above.
This is the gist of the govern-

ment’s reply to the British Am-
bassador's questions as to wheth-
er Germany would be willing to
join an Eastern pact also in case
the other powers were to make
special agreements among them-

selves.
The German Government, how-
ever, desires in this connection

to make its standpoint fully clear:

the completion of non-aggression
and force exclusion pacts by en-
gagements of military assistance,
as considered necessary by the
various powers, contained a. self-
contradiction. Either one be-
lieves voluntarily in undertaken
obligations or one does not. If
one believes in them the neces-
sity for such military agreements
is not apparent.

If one doubts the honest obser-
vation of non—aggression obliga-
tion, then the same doubt is
equally justified as applying to
supplementary military obliga-
tions of such peace pacts. If it
is possible that from non-aggree-
eion pacts ware may come, it is
equally possible that from defen-
sive aid pacts offensive acts may
spring. Only 11: seems to the Ger-
man Government that the way
from non—aggreesion and exclu-
sion pacts to a breach of peace
is longer than the way from mili-
tary obligations of a defensive na-
ture to an offensive act.

The German Government still
sees in this development of mili-
tary alliances in Europe no ele—
ment of a collective peaceful
movement. nor yet a. guarantee of
peace. It is, therefore, unable to
sign pacts which contain such ob-
ligations as an integral part,
whether for all or for single par—
ticipants. The foregoing has been
communicated officially to the
British Embassy in Berlin by the
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
